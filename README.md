This is an extension for Google Chrome to add the loved skip-to-next-top-level-comment-button from the mobile reddit apps to the desktop (web) version of reddit.

The button will be positioned on the middle left side of the screen by default.

## Instructions

- Open a reddit post page
- Wait until top comments have loaded
- Click on the button to jump to the next comment
- Hold and drag (default 500 milliseconds) to reposition the button
- You can alter several options in the action menu of the extension. Just click on the icon in the extension popover.
